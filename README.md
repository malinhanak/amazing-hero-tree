# Brought to you by me and Creat React App 😉

Only a little app that lets you checkout a visualized file tree!

## What can you do? 🚀

In this modest little app you can run following scripts.

The app visualizes a given tree structure.

There are two brances, the version/first is hard coded structure, which I started out with,
the main branch is the final version.

### `yarn start`

Runs 🏃‍♀️ the app in the development mode. Before running start script you need to run `yarn install` to install the project dependencies.

Will spin up on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) if available to view.

### `yarn test`

Launches 🚀 the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds 🏗️ the app for production to the `build` folder.
If you have [https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve](serve) installed you can check out the production version.

Or ju can always run `yarn global add serve`in a local terminal to get the serve package so you can checkout above mentioned version.

With serve installed you can run `serve build`
